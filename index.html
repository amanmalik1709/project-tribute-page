                </p>
                <p>
                    Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American businessman, 
                    inventor, and investor best known for co-founding the technology giant Apple Inc. 
                    Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. 
                    He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along 
                    with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.
                    <br><br>
                    Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended 
                    Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through 
                    India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak 
                    co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal 
                    computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and 
                    sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. 
                    Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and 
                    had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful 
                    Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first 
                    mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing 
                    industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer 
                    to feature vector graphics and PostScript.

                    <h3>Early Life</h3>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955, to Joanne Carole 
                    Schieble and Abdulfattah "John" Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي). Abdulfattah Jandali was 
                    born in a Muslim household to wealthy Syrian parents, the youngest of nine siblings. After 
                    obtaining his undergraduate degree at the American University of Beirut, Jandali pursued a 
                    PhD in political science at the University of Wisconsin. There, he met Joanne Schieble, an 
                    American Catholic of Swiss-German descent whose parents owned a mink farm and real estate in 
                    Green Bay. The two fell in love but faced opposition from Schieble's father due to Jandali's 
                    Muslim faith. When Schieble became pregnant, she arranged for a closed adoption, and travelled to 
                    San Francisco to give birth.
                    <br><br>
                    In his youth, Jobs's parents took him to a Lutheran church. When Steve was in high school, 
                    Clara admitted to his girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, that she "was too frightened to love [Steve] for 
                    the first six months of his life ... I was scared they were going to take him away from me. Even 
                    after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made 
                    a mistake. I wanted to return him." When Chrisann shared this comment with Steve, he stated that he 
                    was already aware,[6] and later said that he had been deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara.
                    Many years later, Jobs's wife Laurene also noted that "he felt he had been really blessed by having 
                    the two of them as parents".[7][page needed] Jobs would "bristle" when Paul and Clara were referred 
                    to as his "adoptive parents", and he regarded them as his parents "1,000%". Jobs referred to his 
                    biological parents as "my sperm and egg bank. That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm 
                    bank thing, nothing more.
                    <br><br>
                    Paul Jobs worked in several jobs that included a try as a machinist, several other jobs, and then 
                    "back to work as a machinist".
                    <br><br>
                    Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957, and by 1959 the family had moved to the Monta 
                    Loma neighborhood in Mountain View, California. Paul built a workbench in his garage for his son 
                    in order to "pass along his love of mechanics". Jobs, meanwhile, admired his father's craftsmanship 
                    "because he knew how to build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our 
                    fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him ... I wasn't that into fixing cars ... but I was 
                    eager to hang out with my dad." By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics 
                    and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood. He had difficulty making friends
                    with children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a "loner".

                    <h3>Pre Apple</h3>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back in Silicon Valley in the autumn of 1974, Jobs reconnected with Stephen Wozniak, a former high school friend who was working for 
                    the Hewlett-Packard Company. When Wozniak told Jobs of his progress in designing his own computer logic board, Jobs suggested that 
                    they go into business together, which they did after Hewlett-Packard formally turned down Wozniak’s design in 1976. The Apple I, as 
                    they called the logic board, was built in the Jobses’ family garage with money they obtained by selling Jobs’s Volkswagen minibus and 
                    Wozniak’s programmable calculator.
                    <br><br>
                    Jobs was one of the first entrepreneurs to understand that the personal computer would appeal to a broad audience, at least if it did 
                    not appear to belong in a junior high school science fair. With Jobs’s encouragement, Wozniak designed an improved model, the Apple 
                    II, complete with a keyboard, and they arranged to have a sleek, molded plastic case manufactured to enclose the unit.
                    <br><br>
                    Though Jobs had long, unkempt hair and eschewed business garb, he managed to obtain financing, distribution, and publicity for the 
                    company, Apple Computer, incorporated in 1977—the same year that the Apple II was completed. The machine was an immediate success, 
                    becoming synonymous with the boom in personal computers. In 1981 the company had a record-setting public stock offering, and in 1983 
                    it made the quickest entrance (to that time) into the Fortune 500 list of America’s top companies. In 1983 the company recruited 
                    PepsiCo, Inc., president John Sculley to be its chief executive officer (CEO) and, implicitly, Jobs’s mentor in the fine points of 
                    running a large corporation. Jobs had convinced Sculley to accept the position by challenging him: “Do you want to sell sugar water 
                    for the rest of your life?” The line was shrewdly effective, but it also revealed Jobs’s own near-messianic belief in the computer 
                    revolution.
                    <br><br>
                    During that same period, Jobs was heading the most important project in the company’s history. In 1979 he led a small group of Apple 
                    engineers to a technology demonstration at the Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) to see how the graphical user 
                    interface could make computers easier to use and more efficient. Soon afterward, Jobs left the engineering team that was designing 
                    Lisa, a business computer, to head a smaller group building a lower-cost computer. Both computers were redesigned to exploit and 
                    refine the PARC ideas, but Jobs was explicit in favouring the Macintosh, or Mac, as the new computer became known. Jobs coddled his 
                    engineers and referred to them as artists, but his style was uncompromising; at one point he demanded a redesign of an internal 
                    circuit board simply because he considered it unattractive. He would later be renowned for his insistence that the Macintosh be not 
                    merely great but “insanely great.” In January 1984 Jobs himself introduced the Macintosh in a brilliantly choreographed demonstration 
                    that was the centrepiece of an extraordinary publicity campaign. It would later be pointed to as the archetype of “event marketing.”
                    <br><br>
                    However, the first Macs were underpowered and expensive, and they had few software applications—all of which resulted in disappointing 
                    sales. Apple steadily improved the machine, so that it eventually became the company’s lifeblood as well as the model for all 
                    subsequent computer interfaces. But Jobs’s apparent failure to correct the problem quickly led to tensions in the company, and in 
                    1985 Sculley convinced Apple’s board of directors to remove the company’s famous cofounder.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Jobs quickly started another firm, NeXT Inc., designing powerful workstation computers for the education market. His funding partners 
                    included Texan entrepreneur Ross Perot and Canon Inc., a Japanese electronics company. Although the NeXT computer was notable for its 
                    engineering design, it was eclipsed by less costly computers from competitors such as Sun Microsystems, Inc. In the early 1990s Jobs 
                    focused the company on its innovative software system, NEXTSTEP.
                    <br><br>
                    Meanwhile, in 1986 Jobs acquired a controlling interest in Pixar, a computer graphics firm that had been founded as a division of 
                    Lucasfilm Ltd., the production company of Hollywood movie director George Lucas. Over the following decade Jobs built Pixar into a 
                    major animation studio that, among other achievements, produced the first full-length feature film to be completely computer-animated, 
                    Toy Story, in 1995. Pixar’s public stock offering that year made Jobs, for the first time, a billionaire. He eventually sold the 
                    studio to the Disney Company in 2006.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In late 1996 Apple, saddled by huge financial losses and on the verge of collapse, hired a new chief executive, semiconductor 
                    executive Gilbert Amelio. When Amelio learned that the company, following intense and prolonged research efforts, had failed to 
                    develop an acceptable replacement for the Macintosh’s aging operating system (OS), he chose NEXTSTEP, buying Jobs’s company for 
                    more than $400 million—and bringing Jobs back to Apple as a consultant. However, Apple’s board of directors soon became disenchanted 
                    with Amelio’s inability to turn the company’s finances around and in June 1997 requested Apple’s prodigal cofounder to lead the 
                    company once again. Jobs quickly forged an alliance with Apple’s erstwhile foe, the Microsoft Corporation, scrapped Amelio’s 
                    Mac-clone agreements, and simplified the company’s product line. He also engineered an award-winning advertising campaign that urged 
                    potential customers to “think different” and buy Macintoshes. Just as important is what he did not do: he resisted the temptation to 
                    make machines that ran Microsoft’s Windows OS; nor did he, as some urged, spin off Apple as a software-only company. Jobs believed 
                    that Apple, as the only major personal computer maker with its own operating system, was in a unique position to innovate.
                    <br><br>
                    Innovate he did. In 1998, Jobs introduced the iMac, an egg-shaped, one-piece computer that offered high-speed processing at a 
                    relatively modest price and initiated a trend of high-fashion computers. (Subsequent models sported five different bright colours.) 
                    By the end of the year, the iMac was the nation’s highest-selling personal computer, and Jobs was able to announce consistent profits 
                    for the once-moribund company. The following year, he triumphed once more with the stylish iBook, a laptop computer built with students 
                    in mind, and the G4, a desktop computer sufficiently powerful that (so Apple boasted) it could not be exported under 
                    certain circumstances because it qualified as a supercomputer. Though Apple did not regain the industry dominance it 
                    once had, Steve Jobs had saved his company, and in the process reestablished himself as a master high-technology 
                    marketer and visionary.

                    <h3>Reinventing Apple</h3>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2001 Jobs started reinventing Apple for the 21st century. That was the year that Apple introduced iTunes, a 
                    computer program for playing music and for converting music to the compact MP3 digital format commonly used in 
                    computers and other digital devices. Later the same year, Apple began selling the iPod, a portable MP3 player, 
                    which quickly became the market leader. In 2003 Apple began selling downloadable copies of major record company 
                    songs in MP3 format over the Internet. By 2006 more than one billion songs and videos had been sold through Apple’s 
                    online iTunes Store. In recognition of the growing shift in the company’s business, Jobs officially changed the name 
                    of the company to Apple Inc. on January 9, 2007.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2007 Jobs took the company into the telecommunications business with the introduction of the touch-screen iPhone, 
                    a mobile telephone with capabilities for playing MP3s and videos and for accessing the Internet. Later that year,
                    Apple introduced the iPod Touch, a portable MP3 and gaming device that included built-in Wi-Fi and an iPhone-like 
                    touch screen. Bolstered by the use of the iTunes Store to sell Apple and third-party software, the iPhone and iPod
                    Touch soon boasted more games than any other portable gaming system. Jobs announced in 2008 that future releases 
                    of the iPhone and iPod Touch would offer improved game functionality. In an ironic development, Apple, which had 
                    not supported game developers in its early years out of fear of its computers not being taken seriously as business 
                    machines, was now staking a claim to a greater role in the gaming business to go along with its move into 
                    telecommunications.

                <p>
                    Steve Jobs, the visionary co-founder of Apple Inc., spent his final days surrounded by family in his Palo Alto home, 
                    maintaining a poignant balance of serenity and reflection. As pancreatic cancer took its toll, Jobs' physical decline 
                    became more pronounced, yet his presence remained a testament to his enduring spirit and sharp intellect. On October 5,
                    2011, his last day, Jobs was notably quiet, his normally vibrant energy subdued by the illness. Family members, 
                    including his wife Laurene and his children, gathered around him, providing comfort and support in these precious 
                    final moments.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout the day, Jobs exhibited moments of lucidity interspersed with periods of rest. Those who knew him well
